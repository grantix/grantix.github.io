      <p>Instead of jumping right to animal shelters, maybe the first step in finding a Pandemic Pet is
        choosing a species or a breed.  The graph below can be toggled with buttons between the search trends for
        'Cats' or 'Dogs'.

  <div class="introBox">
    <p>The most interesting observation from this data is that searches for both cats and dogs
      spiked around March 22.  This was one week after most U.S. companies decided to go remote!
    </p>
    <p>As most U.S. companies are still working-from-home, the search trend remains significatly
      elevated.  And sorry to all the canine lovers out there...cats are searched for about 10% more than dogs are this year.

  <div class="introBox">
    <p>Regardless of the search terms and popularity contests, bringing a pet into your family is a big decision... and
      it costs money!
    </p>
    <p> Speaking of financials, would an increased interest in Pandemic Pets have any noticeable economic impact?
