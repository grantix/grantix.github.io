      <p>From this data we can observe that over the last 8 months there has been a 10% increase
        in individuals searching for nearby Animal Shelters!
      </p>
      <p>Curiously though, the increase is not exponential like the rise in COVID-19 cases in the U.S.
        that we saw in the last graph. Maybe people aren't interested in adopting from a shelter
        and would rather buy from a breeder.
      </p>

      <p>This graph alone can't prove a true correlation between new pets and the pandemic, but maybe
        if we dive down deeper...
